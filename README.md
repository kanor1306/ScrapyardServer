# Scrapyard Server

This is a Node.js server where I test different libraries and where I make my experiments. The libraries that I'm using in the server is Bluebird for promises, PG for the communication with PostgreSQL, Swagger for the online documentation of the web services. Algo I'm planning in adding Bookshelf for the queries of the database.

Right now there are a bunch of different web services that allows to create users, associate users with games, asosicta emusic albums with users and also relate the albums with games.

It is pending to add the schema of the database and to fix some details of the queries.
