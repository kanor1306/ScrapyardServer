# Scrapyard Server

The idea of this server is to be the backend of an application where a user can tell what music albums, books, videogames, etc, he has. There also will be space for relate all the mentioned items with artists, labels, video game studio, writers, etc.

Also, the more interesting part of the app will be that the user will be able to create a relation between songs and all the mntioned items. This can lead to create ranks with the best songs for an specific game, a book, etc

This is being based in a simple user management server that I did some time ago. At first I started thinking in reuse a lot of work, but right now, as my Node abilities has improved, I'm doing it from scratch. Anyway, there are still some old classes that must be removed.


Right now in development, so it is not working :)

The advances, in the form of a Swagger API can be seen in: http://scrapyardserver.herokuapp.com/
